1 store data in html without textareas so rendering math is much easier

			<div class="content text_content">
				<p class="editable math">
					f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty
					\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}
					\,d\xi
				</p>
			</div>

This means that if I want to edit the text/equations, I need to grab the contents of p.editable
and send it to codemirror

QUESTIONS:

Are stateful controllers needed?  The javascript context associated with the window can already
keep state, so then is it not sufficient to maintain that and convert all the controllers into 
simple functions that reference the stateful app object?
