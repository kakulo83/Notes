**************************************** FEATURES TO ADD **************************************** 

		Make saving/writing to file more efficient:
			- Check if the content being added is at the end.  If it is use node's fs.appendFile 
				function to add to the tailend of the file

			- If the content being added is somewhere in the middle, perform the more expensive
				complete document write


		wrap keypress handler in an object/hash.  This way if another controller extends 
		the ObjectController it can simply rewrite over the key: function() 


		modify search: 
			
			- ( keyword_or_phrase tags:tag1,tag2,tag3 code:true image:true video:true math:true )
			
			- elasticsearch should index not only the title and content, but if there is an image,
				video, code, or math content associated with the content

					- then apply a boolean filter for the results



		add more complex and powerful searching with elasticsearch	
			- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60UsHHsKyN4
			- keep complex elasticsearch tags (ex "how do I create a new shard") in a hidden div 


		add in-page content search with '/' 
			- use Ag (silver searcher)

	
		syncrhonize create/update/destroy in elasticsearch
			- deleting a document should also delete the corresponding elasticsearch entry


		add INDEX view
			- Instead of a tree graph layout, list objects like NERDTree does, basically collapsible just
				like content in an object view 


		add QUESTIONS view 
			- keep track of questions/queries that need to be answered


		add ability to augment content with tags that can be used with searching
			- add tags to images
			- add tags to equations
			- add tags to text
			- add tags to video

		
		syncrhonize tree mode nodes with object files
			- Add prompt when I try to delete a tree node, the implication being that the corresponding
				node.object file will be deleted	

		
		add additional hot-key navigation
			- Shift+H, Shift+M, Shift_L should move the current content to HIGH/MIDDLE/LOW positions
			- gg should set the first content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly
			- G should set the last content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly


		add ability to create wiki-links
			- Add vimium like mechanism for navigating to links using "f" key to show yellow
				quicklink letters
							- pressing uppercase "F" and navigating to the link will Pop 
								open a new Window with the content
			- Add a stack structure to store history of Objects viewed so quick navigation
			backwards can be made using <Ctrl-o> for backwards


		start application from cmd-line with/without subject

		start application from executable icon (no subject)

		refactor object_controller makeactive
			- refactor object_controller.js makeActive function to simply accept a full filepath instead of "selection"
				which is an object of type:  { "name": objectName, "file": filePath }


******************************************  FIXES  ***************************************** 

		- append content immediately after folded content makes it such that the folded content
			does not reappear when unfolding AND the newly appended content is inserted between
			the parent of the folded content and the folded content; wrong location

		- appending between content results it being pushed to the end of all content

		- collapsing content error in process view

				- open "creating an index process" node

				- collapsing the first process results in the second one also be hidden and untoggleable


		- linking is broken again:  ~ 975 in ObjectController 

		- detaching a node and making it orphan results in a fileread error when reattaching it to the tree,
			the reattaching does not include the directory 'objects' in the file path:

				ex:  /Users/robertcarter/Documents/VIL/elastic_search.notes/objects/...   

		- if a node in tree mode is renamed, the connection between the object-mode and process-mode is broken

		- deleting a node on the tree should truly delete without me having to manually save ":w" 

		- collapsing the title screws up the page's contents
		- on object page "mary" 
					1.  collapsing any of the middle math contents 
					2.  re-expand the maht contents, the remainder contents will still be set to display: none;
