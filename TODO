**************************************** FEATURES TO ADD **************************************** 

		add more complex and powerful searching with elasticsearch	
			- keep complex elasticsearch tags (ex "how do I create a new shard") in a hidden div 


		add global object file search with '<cTRL>p'
			- Add ability to search multiple words i.e  "Cheat Sheet"
			- Fix problem of highlighting multi word queries


		add in-page content search with '/' 
			- use Ag (silver searcher)

	
		syncrhonize create/update/destroy in elasticsearch
			- deleting a document should also delete the corresponding elasticsearch entry


		add code_content type
			- Highlight library:  https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js
			- colorize each languages differently (mimic railscasts)

	
		add INDEX view
			- Instead of a tree graph layout, list objects like NERDTree does, basically collapsible just
				like content in an object view 


		add QUESTIONS view 
			- keep track of questions/queries that need to be answered



		add ability to augment content with tags that can be used with searching
			- add tags to images
			- add tags to equations
			- add tags to text
			- add tags to video


		add ability to move tree-nodes (and their children) to new locations without having to make them orphans


		syncrhonize tree mode nodes with object files
			- Add prompt when I try to delete a tree node, the implication being that the corresponding
				node.object file will be deleted	

		
		modify the mode-menu
			- (A)ppend content should be entry point to adding new content.  If "a" is pressed, a 
				new menu should replace the current mode-menu with the type of contents that can be added:
		
							(t)ext
							(i)mage
							(v)ideo
							(m)ath text


		add additional hot-key navigation
			- Shift+H, Shift+M, Shift_L should move the current content to HIGH/MIDDLE/LOW positions
			- gg should set the first content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly
			- G should set the last content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly

		add ability to create wiki-links
			- Add vimium like mechanism for navigating to links using "f" key to show yellow
				quicklink letters
							- pressing uppercase "F" and navigating to the link will Pop 
								open a new Window with the content
			- Add a stack structure to store history of Objects viewed so quick navigation
			backwards can be made using <Ctrl-o> for backwards

		add ability to open other notes

		start application from cmd-line with/without subject

		start application from executable icon (no subject)

		refactor object_controller makeactive
			- refactor object_controller.js makeActive function to simply accept a full filepath instead of "selection"
				which is an object of type:  { "name": objectName, "file": filePath }


******************************************  FIXES  ***************************************** 

		- collapsing content error in process view

				- open "creating an index process" node

				- collapsing the first process results in the second one also be hidden and untoggleable


		- linking is broken again:  ~ 975 in ObjectController 

		- detaching a node and making it orphan results in a fileread error when reattaching it to the tree,
			the reattaching does not include the directory 'objects' in the file path:

				ex:  /Users/robertcarter/Documents/VIL/elastic_search.notes/objects/...   

		- if a node in tree mode is renamed, the connection between the object-mode and process-mode is broken

		- deleting a node on the tree should truly delete without me having to manually save ":w" 

		- collapsing the title screws up the page's contents
		- on object page "mary" 
					1.  collapsing any of the middle math contents 
					2.  re-expand the maht contents, the remainder contents will still be set to display: none;
