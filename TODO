TODO:


ADD ABILITY TO CREATE WIKI-LINKS

		- First modify how codemirror+vim receives input for editing/creating new text content.  If
			all words within a <p> tag are surrounded with <span> tags, they need to be unboxed and 
			reboxed 

					<div class="text_content content" data-depth="0">
						<p class="editable">
							<span class="word">Appended</span> <span class="word">after</span> <span class="word">this</span> <span class="word">text</span> <span class="word">is</span> <span class="word">mathematical</span> <span class="word">text</span> <span class="word">expressed</span> <span class="word">in</span> <span class="word">TeX</span> <span class="word">format</span>.<span class="word">  
							This</span> <span class="word">TeX</span> <span class="word">encoded</span> <span class="word">text</span> <span class="word">will</span> <span class="word">be</span> <span class="word">rendered</span> <span class="word">with</span> <span class="word">the</span> <span class="word">KaTeX</span> <span class="word">front</span>-<span class="word">side</span> <span class="word">javascript</span> <span class="word">engine</span>.
						</p>
					</div>


		- add hot-keys quickly creating a link (Ctrl-l perhaps)

		- Add vimium like mechanism for navigating to links using "f" key to show yellow
			quicklink letters

		- Add code mechanism in ObjectController to navigate to new linked Object
		
		- Add a stack structure to store history of Objects viewed so quick navigation
			backwards can be made using <Ctrl-o> for backwards



PROMPT IF FILE NEEDS SAVING
		- if content is shifted, added, deleted, or new links embedded on the page, in short if
			the file is modified, exiting or changing mode's should result in a prompt to save the file


ADD ADDITIONAL QUICK-KEY NAVIGATION
		- Shift+H, Shift+M, Shift_L should move the current content to HIGH/MIDDLE/LOW positions

		- gg should set the first content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly

		- G should set the last content as the current content, and shift the page accordingly


MODIFY THE MODE-MENU
		- (A)ppend content should be entry point to adding new content.  If "a" is pressed, a 
			new menu should replace the current mode-menu with the type of contents that can be added:
		
				(t)ext
				(i)mage
				(v)ideo
				(m)ath text
